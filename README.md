# OTA Update FHE: A Secure FHE-Based Protocol for Over-the-Air Software Updates for Vehicles ðŸš—ðŸ”’

OTA Update FHE is a cutting-edge protocol that leverages **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology to enable secure over-the-air (OTA) software updates for vehicles. By ensuring that both the update packages and the vehicle identities are encrypted with FHE, this solution guarantees a safe update process, protecting against hacking attempts and safeguarding owners' privacy.

## The Challenge of Secure OTA Updates

As vehicles become increasingly interconnected and reliant on software, the need for secure OTA updates has never been more critical. Without proper security, these updates can be intercepted, tampered with, or even used as a vector for malicious attacks. Car manufacturers and users face a significant threat: how can we ensure the integrity of software updates while maintaining user privacy? 

## The FHE Solution

This is where Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology becomes a game-changer. By implementing FHE, OTA Update FHE allows encrypted data to be processed without needing to decrypt it first. This means that even if a hacker gains access to the transmission, they see only ciphertext, which is practically impossible to decipher without the corresponding key. The solution is built using Zamaâ€™s open-source libraries such as **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, providing a strong foundation for confidential computing in the automotive industry.

## Core Functionalities

OTA Update FHE features several essential functionalities that address the outlined challenges:

- **FHE Encryption of Update Packages:** Ensures that the contents of update files are encrypted during transmission, enhancing data confidentiality.
- **Vehicle Identity Protection:** Uses FHE to secure vehicle identity information, preventing unauthorized access or spoofing.
- **Tamper-proof Update Logging:** Keeps a secure log of all update processes to ensure integrity and accountability.
- **Seamless Integration:** Designed specifically for smart vehicles, the protocol integrates effortlessly into existing vehicle management systems.

## Technology Stack

The project harnesses a variety of technologies for maximum efficiency:

- **Zama FHE SDK:** The cornerstone of our confidential computing framework, responsible for handling FHE operations.
- **Node.js:** Provides a robust platform for running the project environment.
- **Hardhat:** A development environment to compile, deploy, and test smart contracts effectively.
- **Docker:** Ensures consistent environments for deployment across different stages.

## Project Structure

Hereâ€™s the directory structure for the OTA Update FHE project:

```
otaUpdateFHE/
â”œâ”€â”€ contracts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ otaUpdateFHE.sol
â”œâ”€â”€ logs/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ update_log.json
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main.js
â”œâ”€â”€ test/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ otaUpdateFHE.test.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Installation Guide

To set up the OTA Update FHE protocol, follow these steps carefully:

1. Ensure you have **Node.js** installed on your machine.
2. Install **Hardhat** by running: 
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev hardhat
   ```
3. Navigate to the project's root directory.
4. Run the command below to install all necessary dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   **Note:** Avoid using `git clone` or any repository URLs. Obtain the project files through other means.

## Build & Run Guide

To compile, test, and run the OTA Update FHE protocol, follow these commands in your terminal:

1. To compile the smart contracts, run:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```
2. To execute the tests and ensure that everything is functioning properly, run:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```
3. To deploy the contract to a suitable environment, use:
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
   ```

## Example Usage

Hereâ€™s a code snippet that demonstrates how to initialize an OTA update process while leveraging the FHE capabilities:

```javascript
const { FHEEncrypt, FHEDecrypt } = require('zama-fhe-sdk');

async function initiateOTAUpdate(updatePackage, vehicleId) {
    // Encrypt the update package and vehicle ID
    const encryptedPackage = await FHEEncrypt(updatePackage);
    const encryptedVehicleId = await FHEEncrypt(vehicleId);
    
    // Proceed with the OTA update using encrypted data
    console.log(`Initiating OTA update for vehicle ID: ${encryptedVehicleId}`);
    // Call the smart contract function to perform the update
    // smartContract.update(encryptedVehicleId, encryptedPackage);
}

// Example of calling the function with sample data
initiateOTAUpdate('SoftwareVersion_1.02', 'VehicleID_123456');
```
